## How to make your sample map

1.  make a *Dirt-Samples* folder in the directory of your site/page
2.  copy whichever sample folders you want into that directory 
3.  `cd` to that directory on the command line
4. make sure *makeSampleMap.sh* is in that directory
5. run `./makeSampleMap.sh Dirt-Samples`
6. copy the output from the terminal and paste it into *sampleMap.json* (overwrite everything in there already)
7. done!
